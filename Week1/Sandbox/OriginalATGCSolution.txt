# EXPLANATION
# 1) Get rid of first line and newline characters so grep works correctly - save the truncated E.coli fasta in a new file
# 2) The echos and greps are there (and wc after grep - see Q4 for explanation) so that the file 'Sum.txt' will eventually read out "(numA + num T)/(numG + numC)". Lots of redirecting to Sum.txt to do this.
# Note that echo -n used: this stops the trailing \n when adding to Sum.txt, as bc (the calculator) won't be able to read the file if there's newline characters.
# Also note that as each grep is a new command (&& not | used) the filename needs to be put everytime.
# 3) 'scale=3;' put at the beginning so bc gives the answer to 3 decimal places
# 4) After the echos and greps, the newline characters need to be taken out, as although echo -n has been used, the wc still produces a trailing newline. tr -d used to do this.
# The output must be saved to a new file (hence > FinalSum.txt), as tr doesn't actually alter the file Sum.txt, it just prints out an altered version while leaving the actual file the same. 
# The output couldn't be redirected back to Sum.txt as '< Sum.txt > Sum.txt' breaks everything.
# 5) After all the newline characters have been removed, echo "" adds a newline character at the end (as without -n there's a trailing \n) as br doesn't work if there isn't \n at the end.
# 6) Finally, print out the file FinalSum.txt using cat, and pipe it to bc so it can calculate the answer.
