## Week 2 Content

This week we covered:
- Intro to Python
- Python input and output
- For loops vs list comprehensions
- Variable scope (global variables)
- Debugging in Python

**Language(s):** Python - version 3.6.3

**Dependencies:** No package dependencies

### Project structure

4 directories:
- **Code** - shell scripts and text docs with answers
- **Data** - data that some scripts are run on
- **Results** - results eg. data manipulation outputs (note: empty)
- (Local repo also contains **Sandbox** with test files)

### File descriptions

- **Align_seqs.py** - Finds the best alignment of two DNA sequences - ie. the alignment with the most matched bases
- **Basic_csv.py** - Reads a csv file and both prints it to the console and writes select data to a new file
- **Basic_io1.py** - Opens and reads a test file, both with and without blank lines
- **Basic_io2.py** - Creates a file and writes a list to it
- **Basic_io3.py** - Uses package 'pickle' to save an object and reload it
- **Boilerplate.py** - Basic boilerplate script demonstrating use of "main" function
- **Cfexercises1.py** - Some functions that sort or manipulate number inputs
- **Cfexercises2.py** - Some while and for loops that print 'hello' if a particular numerical expression is true
- **Control_flow.py** - Some functions exemplifying the use of control statements
- **Debugme.py** - An intentionally buggy function that demonstrates use of try and except
- **Dictionary.py** - Populates a dictionary with taxa dataset so that it maps order names to sets of taxa
- **Lc1.py** - Contains list comprehensions and for loops to create separate lists containing the latin names, common names, and body masses of birds from a birds database
- **Lc2.py** - Contains list comprehensions and for loops to manipulate UK rainfall data
- **Loops.py** - Some for and while loops that print various numerical/list manipulations
- **Oaks.py** - Defines a function that finds oak species from a dataset and uses for loops and list comprehensions to print them in a list
- **Scope.py** - Functions that demonstrate the scope of global and local variables in different contexts
- **Sysargv.py** -Demonstrates how to use 'sys' package
- **Test_control_flow.py** - Demonstrates the use of 'doctest' package
- **Tuple.py** - Prints the output of a 'birds' dataset by species, showing latin name, common name and body mass
- **Using_name.py** - d=Demonstrates how (\__name__ == "\__main"__) works
