  abstract = {When several models can describe a biological process, the equation that best fits the data is typically considered the best. However, models are most useful when they also possess biologically-meaningful parameters. In particular, model parameters should be stable, physically interpretable, and transferable to other contexts, e.g. for direct indication of system state, or usage in other model types. As an example of implementing these recommended requirements for model parameters, we evaluated twelve published empirical models for temperature-dependent tropical seagrass photosynthesis, based on two criteria: (1) goodness of fit, and (2) how easily biologically-meaningful parameters can be obtained. All models were formulated in terms of parameters characterising the thermal optimum (Topt) for maximum photosynthetic rate (Pmax). These parameters indicate the upper thermal limits of seagrass photosynthetic capacity, and hence can be used to assess the vulnerability of seagrass to temperature change. Our study exemplifies an approach to model selection which optimises the usefulness of empirical models for both modellers and ecologists alike.},

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

The model thus provides a synthetic, mechanistic framework for linking global biogeochemical cycles to cellular-, individual- and community-level processes.},

All physiological rates investigated increased with increasing temperature. Q10 values were similar for all rate changes and were comparable to those which have been reported for other protozoa. In contrast to all rates, microflagellate gross growth efficiency and cell volume were unaffected by temperature. Decreases in the concentrations of particulate carbon and particulate nitrogen from grazed diatom cultures also were similar when summed over the entire growth phase of the microflagellate population. Therefore, the proportions of ingested carbon and nitrogen which were incorporated or remineralized by the microflagellate were independent of temperature between 14 and 26\textdegree C. At temperatures above 18\textdegree C, growth rates of P. imperforata were greater than the maximum growth rates reported for most phytoplankton. We conclude that the impact of P. imperforata on natural phytoplankton communities is not controlled by temperature above 18\textdegree C but may be affected by the rate at which zooplankton or microzooplankton prey on the microflagellate, as well as the inability of the microflagellate to graze efficiently when phytoplankton are present at low cell densities.},

  abstract = {Since 1730 when Reaumut introduced the concept of heat units, many methods of calculating thermal physiological time heat have been used to simulate the phenology of poikilothermic organisms in biological and agricultural sciences. Most of these models are grounded on the concept of the ``law of total effective temperatures'', which abstracts the temperature responses of a particular species, in which a specific amount of thermal units should be accumulated above a temperature threshold, to complete a certain developmental event. However, the above temperature summation rule is valid within the species-specific temperature range of development and therefore several empirical linear and nonlinear regression models, including the derivation of the biophysical models as well, have been proposed to define these critical temperatures for development. Additionally, several statistical measures based on ordinary least squares instead of likelihoods, have been also proposed for parameter estimation and model comparison. Given the importance of predicting distribution of insects, for insect ecology and pest management, this article reviews representative temperature-driven models, heat accumulation systems and statistical model evaluation criteria, in an attempt to describe continuous and progressive improvement of the physiological time concept in current entomological science and to infer the ecological consequences for insect spatiotemporal arrangements.},

The unprecedented diversity of traits (n = 112), species (n = 309), body sizes (15 orders of magnitude), and habitats (all major biomes) in our database allows us to quantify novel features of the temperature response of biological traits. In particular, analysis of the rising component of within-species (intraspecific) responses reveals that 87\% are fit well by the Boltzmann\textendash Arrhenius model. The mean activation energy for these rises is 0.66 {$\pm$} 0.05 eV, similar to the reported across-species (interspecific) value of 0.65 eV. However, systematic variation in the distribution of rise activation energies is evident, including previously unrecognized right skewness around a median of 0.55 eV. This skewness exists across levels of organization, taxa, trophic groups, and habitats, and it is partially explained by prey having increased trait performance at lower temperatures relative to predators, suggesting a thermal version of the life-dinner principle\textemdash stronger selection on running for your life than running for your dinner. For unimodal responses, habitat (marine, freshwater, and terrestrial) largely explains the mean temperature at which trait values are optimal but not variation around the mean. The distribution of activation energies for trait falls has a mean of 1.15 {$\pm$} 0.39 eV (significantly higher than rises) and is also right-skewed. Our results highlight generalities and deviations in the thermal response of biological traits and help to provide a basis to predict better how biological systems, from cells to communities, respond to temperature change.},

The maximum light utilization coefficient ({$\alpha$}C) was insensitive or decreased slightly with increasing temperature. Absolute rates of O2 production were calculated from pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometry measurements in combination with biooptical determination of absorbed quanta in PSII. The relationship between PAM-based O2 production and measured O2 production and 14C assimilation showed a species-specific correlation, with 1.2\textendash 3.3 times higher absolute values of PCmax and {$\alpha$}C when calculated from PAM data for Pry. parvum and Ph. tricornutum but equivalent for Pro. minimum.

Conclusively, the PAM technique can be used to study temperature responses of photosynthesis in microalgae when paying attention to the absorption properties in PSII.},

However, the magnitude of impacts depends not only on the degree of warming but also on the number of species at risk, their physiological sensitivity to warming and their options for behavioural and physiological compensation. Lizards are useful for evaluating risks of warming because their thermal biology is well studied. We conducted macrophysiological analyses of diurnal lizards from diverse latitudes plus focal species analyses of Puerto Rican Anolis and Sphaerodactyus. Although tropical lowland lizards live in environments that are warm all year, macrophysiological analyses indicate that some tropical lineages (thermoconformers that live in forests) are active at low body temperature and are intolerant of warm temperatures. Focal species analyses show that some tropical forest lizards were already experiencing stressful body temperatures in summer when studied several decades ago. Simulations suggest that warming will not only further depress their physiological performance in summer, but will also enable warm-adapted, open-habitat competitors and predators to invade forests. Forest lizards are key components of tropical ecosystems, but appear vulnerable to the cascading physiological and ecological effects of climate warming, even though rates of tropical warming may be relatively low.},

Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark\textendash recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented.

To correctly describe the thermal performance of these organisms, functions are needed which sufficiently fit to the complete optimum curve. Surprisingly, model-comparisons for the temperature-dependence of population growth rates of an important ectothermic group, the protozoa, are still missing. In this study, temperature reaction norms of natural isolates of the freshwater protist Paramecium caudatum were investigated, considering nearly the entire temperature range. These reaction norms were used to estimate thermal performance curves by applying a set of commonly used model functions. An information theory approach was used to compare models and to identify the best ones for describing these data. Our results indicate that the models which can describe negative growth at the high- and low-temperature branch of an optimum curve are preferable. This is a prerequisite for accurately calculating the critical upper and lower thermal limits. While we detected a temperature optimum of around 29\textdegree C for all investigated clonal strains, the critical thermal limits were considerably different between individual clones. Here, the tropical clone showed the narrowest thermal tolerance, with a shift of its critical thermal limits to higher temperatures.},

  abstract = {We review the current understanding of the temperature responses of C3 and C4 photosynthesis across thermal ranges that do not harm the photosynthetic apparatus. In C3 species, photosynthesis is classically considered to be limited by the capacities of ribulose 1{$\cdot$}5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration or Pi regeneration. Using both theoretical and empirical evidence, we describe the temperature response of instantaneous net CO2 assimilation rate (A) in terms of these limitations, and evaluate possible limitations on A at elevated temperatures arising from heat-induced lability of Rubisco activase. In C3 plants, Rubisco capacity is the predominant limitation on A across a wide range of temperatures at low CO2 ({$<$}300 \textmu bar), while at elevated CO2, the limitation shifts to Pi regeneration capacity at suboptimal temperatures, and either electron transport capacity or Rubisco activase capacity at supraoptimal temperatures. In C4 plants, Rubisco capacity limits A below 20 \textdegree C in chilling-tolerant species, but the control over A at elevated temperature remains uncertain. Acclimation of C3 photosynthesis to suboptimal growth temperature is commonly associated with a disproportional enhancement of the Pi regeneration capacity. Above the thermal optimum, acclimation of A to increasing growth temperature is associated with increased electron transport capacity and/or greater heat stability of Rubisco activase. In many C4 species from warm habitats, acclimation to cooler growth conditions increases levels of Rubisco and C4 cycle enzymes which then enhance A below the thermal optimum. By contrast, few C4 species adapted to cooler habitats increase Rubisco content during acclimation to reduced growth temperature; as a result, A changes little at suboptimal temperatures. Global change is likely to cause a widespread shift in patterns of photosynthetic limitation in higher plants. Limitations in electron transport and Rubisco activase capacity should be more common in the warmer, high CO2 conditions expected by the end of the century.},

  abstract = {Biological temperature-dependent rate models based on Arrhenius' and Eyring's equations have been formulated by Johnson \& Lewin (1946), Hultin (1955), and Sharpe \& DeMichele (1977). The original formulation of Sharpe and DeMichele is poorly suited for non-linear regression. Very high correlations of parameter estimators occassionally make regression with their equation impossible using Marquardt's algorithm (1963). This analysis describes a new formulation of Sharpe and DeMichele's model that greatly alleviates the non-linear regression problem. It is partly based on Hultin's formulation (1955). Biological and graphical interpretation of the model parameters is discussed. Regression suitability is illustrated with a typical data set. Similar modifications to the equations of Hultin (1955) and Johnson \& Lewin (1946) are described.},

  abstract = {Biological modeling is an important investigation tool in oceanography, which can provide an insight into biological dynamics, integrate multi-disciplinary processes and predict ecological events. However, the lack of a common set of parameterizations of fundamental biological processes hinders progresses in simulation skill, reliability and predictability. There exist 13 functions for light forcing on phytoplankton growth, 5 for nutrient limitation, 6 for ammonium inhibition on nitrate uptake, 10 for temperature forcing on biological rates, 20 for zooplankton feeding on a single type of prey, 15 for feeding on multiple types of prey, 8 for mortality and 6 for respiration. All of these functions are actually in use in modeling applications. This paper presents an overview of the existing functions. Based on their functionality, flexibility and reliability, a subset of functions has been selected as an a priori set of parameterizations. I suggest to use these selected parameterizations when they can fit well the data. By doing this, we can reduce the number of biological parameters that need to be estimated and provide a better opportunity for intercomparison.},

  abstract = {Birthweight distributions have been conceptualized as a predominant Gaussian distribution contaminated in the tails by an unspecified `residual' distribution. Acknowledging this idea, we propose a technique for measuring certain features of birthweight distributions useful to epidemiologists: the mean and variance of the predominant distribution; the proportions of births in the low- and high-birthweight residual distributions, and the boundaries of support for these residual distributions. Our technique, based on an underlying multinomial sampling distribution, involves estimating parameters in a mixture model for the multinomial bin probabilities after having chosen the support of the residual distribution with a model selection criterion. A modest simulation study and experience with a few actual datasets indicate that use of a Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as model selection criterion is superior to use of Akaike's information criterion (AIC) in this application.},

  abstract = {Temperature dependencies of stem dark respiration (Rd) and light-driven bark photosynthesis (Amax) of two temperate tree species (Fagus sylvatica and Betula pendula) were investigated to estimate their probable influence on stem carbon balance. Stem Rd was found to increase exponentially with increasing temperatures, whereas Amax levelled off or decreased at the highest temperatures chosen (35\textendash 40\,\textdegree C). Accordingly, a linear relationship between respiratory and assimilatory metabolism was only found at moderate temperatures (10\textendash 30\,\textdegree C) and the relationship between stem Rd and Amax clearly departed from linearity at chilling (5\,\textdegree C) and at high temperatures (35\textendash 40\,\textdegree C). As a result, the proportional internal C-refixation rate also decreased non-linearly with increasing temperature. Temperature response of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry was also assessed. Bark photochemical yield ({$\Delta$}F/Fm{${'}$}) followed the same temperature pattern as bark CO2 assimilation. Maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm) decreased drastically at freezing temperatures (\textendash 5\,\textdegree C), while from 30 to 40\,\textdegree C only a marginal decrease in Fv/Fm was found. In in situ measurements during winter months, bark photosynthesis was found to be strongly reduced. Low temperature stress induced an active down-regulation of PSII efficiency as well as damage to PSII due to photoinhibition. All in all, the benefit of bark photosynthesis was negatively affected by low (\&lt;5\,\textdegree C) as well as high temperatures (\&gt;30\,\textdegree C). As the carbon balance of tree stems is defined by the difference between photosynthethic carbon gain and respiratory carbon loss, this might have important implications for accurate modelling of stem carbon balance.},

To predict the number of organisms as a function of temperature and time, it is essential to model the lag time, specific growth rate, and asymptote (growth yield) as a function of temperature. The objective of this research was to determine the suitability and usefulness of different models, either available from the literature or newly developed. The models were compared by using an F test, by which the lack of fit of the models was compared with the measuring error. From the results, a hyperbolic model was selected for the description of the lag time as a function of temperature. Modified forms of the Ratkowsky model were selected as the most suitable model for both the growth rate and the asymptote as a function of temperature. The selected models could be used to predict experimentally determined numbers of organisms as a function of temperature and time.},
